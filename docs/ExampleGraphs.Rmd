This is for my class where we are supposed to be creating a package in R.  This is just a means of loading in said package and displaying some graphs of it.

```{r}
library(LeviFlagWeather)
library(ggplot2)
library(lubridate)

example_data <- data.frame(Flagstaff_Weather)

head(example_data)

ggplot(data = example_data, aes(x = ymd(DATE), y = PRCP)) + 
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  labs(x = "Date", y = "Precipitation (inches)",
       title = "Precipitation in Flagstaff over Time")
```
